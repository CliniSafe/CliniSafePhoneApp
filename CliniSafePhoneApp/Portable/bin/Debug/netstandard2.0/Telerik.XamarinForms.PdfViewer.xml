            This class exists because the meaning of Viewport in v1 and v2 of the PdfViewer is different. 
            In v1 the Viewport's scroll is dependent on the zoom, and its size is the same as the size of the presenter.
            Also in v1 a root-size-helper is used which distorts the page size.
